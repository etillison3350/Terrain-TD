# Terrain TD
Terrain TD is an open-world tower defense game that uses terrain/obstacles to redirect enemies, rather than following a distinct path. So far, the game is mostly playable, and hopefully will be more so soon.
## Why did I make this?
I code for fun (<3 code, as [stackoverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com) puts it). I've been programming in Java for around three years now, and still, as I make these things, I find that each day I learn something new. As they say. I've discovered pathfinding, using A* and Djikstra's algorithm (which the game currently uses), some pretty intersting algorithms, including Taylor series and Newtons method (which I don't use), and a whole bunch of other ways to improve performance and UI feel. I also think I made this just to test myself, although perhaps I wasn't conscious of this and perhaps I still am not. I had been working on this for a few months before I uploaded it to GitHub. I started on it probably sometime late in September of 2015, and I've been working on it sporadically since then.
